# Logan Robertson

### Working on:

- [Hedged/Buffered Equity Fund Analysis](https://github.com/loganprob/hedged-equity)
  - pushed recent update on 1/3/24 and am currently taking a break from it to focus on other projects
  - supporting data for the code will still be updated monthly   

### Other:
- [The Junk Drawer](https://github.com/loganprob/junk_drawer)
  - Home for miscellaneous ideas & unfinished projects in their unpolished state; preserved for future inspiration/scavenging
- Playing around with JavaScript: [Interactive Spot/Forward Curve](https://loganprob.github.io/yieldcurve.html) ([Source](https://github.com/loganprob/loganprob.github.io/blob/main/yieldcurve.js))
- [Old blog](https://www.loganr.io/blog)
  - may eventually come to live here
  - someday I'll take a yearlong sabbatical to finish that calculator... genuinely a lot of fun to work on
